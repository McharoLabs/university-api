# University API

This project is a simple Django REST Framework API that provides endpoints for students and subjects. The project is connected to a PostgreSQL database and deployed to an AWS Ubuntu instance.

## API Endpoints

1.  **/students**: Returns a JSON response containing a list of students with their name and enrolled program.

    - Example Response:
      ```json
      [
        { "name": "Kwame Nkrumah", "program": "Software Engineering" },
        { "name": "Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala", "program": "Software Engineering" },
        { "name": "Sizwe Dlamini", "program": "Software Engineering" },
        { "name": "Amina J. Mohammed", "program": "Software Engineering" },
        { "name": "Thabo Mbeki", "program": "Software Engineering" },
        { "name": "Chinua Achebe", "program": "Software Engineering" },
        { "name": "Nelson Mandela", "program": "Software Engineering" },
        { "name": "Wangari Maathai", "program": "Software Engineering" },
        { "name": "Kofi Annan", "program": "Software Engineering" },
        { "name": "Salim Ahmed Salim", "program": "Software Engineering" }
      ]
      ```

2.  **/subjects**: Returns a JSON response listing all subjects associated with the Software Engineering program, spanning from Year 1 through Year 4.
    - Example Response:
      ```json
      {
        "Year 1": ["Math 101", "CS 101", "Intro to Programming"],
        "Year 2": ["Data Structures", "Algorithms", "Discrete Math"],
        "Year 3": [
          "Operating Systems",
          "Database Systems",
          "Software Engineering"
        ],
        "Year 4": ["Machine Learning", "Cloud Computing", "Capstone Project"]
      }
      ```

- **Students Endpoint:** [https://cs.ua.seranise.co.tz/api/students/](https://cs.ua.seranise.co.tz/api/students/)
- **Subjects Endpoint:** [https://cs.ua.seranise.co.tz/api/subjects/](https://cs.ua.seranise.co.tz/api/subjects/)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Django 5.x
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL (for production)

### Installation

1. Create the project directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir project
   cd project
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment to isolate our package dependencies locally:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/McharoLabs/university-api.git](https://github.com/McharoLabs/university-api.git)
   cd university-api
   ```

5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory. Copy the contents of `.env.example` and replace the placeholder values with your actual database credentials:
   ```
   ENGINE=django.db.backends.your_engine
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   DB_USER=your_db_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_user_password
   DB_HOST=your_db_host
   PORT=your_db_port
   ```
   **Important:** Replace `your_engine`, `your_database_name`, `your_db_user`, `your_user_password`, `your_db_host`, and `your_db_port` with your actual database settings. For example, if you are using PostgreSQL, `ENGINE` would be `django.db.backends.postgresql`.
7. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
8. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Tasks

### 0. Backup Schemes

This section explains three backup schemes used in server management, their execution methods, advantages, and disadvantages.

#### 1. Full Backup:

- **Execution:** A full backup involves creating a complete copy of the entire system or database. This is done at regular intervals (e.g., daily, weekly), capturing all files and data in one operation.

- **Advantages:**

  - Easy to restore, as everything is included in the backup.
  - Simple to manage, as there is only one file to restore.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - Time-consuming as it needs to copy everything.
  - Requires a large amount of storage space since all data is backed up.
  - Slow recovery time, especially if the system or database is large.

#### 2. Incremental Backup:

- **Execution:** Incremental backups only capture data that has changed since the last backup (whether full or incremental). This reduces the amount of data that needs to be saved each time.

- **Advantages:**

  - Faster than full backups, as it only backs up modified data.
  - Requires less storage space compared to full backups.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - Restoration can be slower, as all previous incremental backups need to be restored in sequence to fully reconstruct the latest state.
  - Can be more complex to manage because it requires keeping track of multiple backup files.

#### 3. Differential Backup:

- **Execution:** Differential backups capture all changes made since the last full backup. Each differential backup grows larger over time until the next full backup is performed.

- **Advantages:**

  - Faster than full backups, but not as fast as incremental backups.
  - Simpler restoration process than incremental backups, as only the full backup and the last differential backup are needed.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - Requires more storage than incremental backups, since it captures all changes since the last full backup.
  - Over time, differential backups can take longer to complete as the backup grows.

### Bash Scripts

This section describes the three Bash scripts you need to create and use for automating server management tasks.

#### 1. `health_check.sh`

This script will monitor the serverâ€™s health, ensuring the API is running and that system resources like CPU, memory, and disk space are within acceptable limits. The script will check the following:

- Whether the server is running.
- Whether critical services (like the web server and database) are active.
- System resource usage (e.g., CPU load, memory, disk space).

#### 2. `backup_api.sh`

This script will handle the backup of both the database and file system for the API. The script will:

- Perform a full backup of the database (using tools like `pg_dump` for PostgreSQL).
- Backup essential configuration files and application code.
- Optionally, it could automate sending the backups to an external server or cloud storage like AWS S3 for redundancy.

#### 3. `update_server.sh`

This script will automate the process of updating the server software and packages. The script will:

- Update the package lists with `apt-get update`.
- Upgrade all outdated packages with `apt-get upgrade`.
- Ensure that the server is running the latest security patches.
- Optionally, it could also handle reboots if necessary after upgrades.

### Steps to Set Up and Run the Scripts

1. **Create the `bash_scripts` directory:**

   ```bash
   mkdir bash_scripts
   cd bash_scripts
   ```
